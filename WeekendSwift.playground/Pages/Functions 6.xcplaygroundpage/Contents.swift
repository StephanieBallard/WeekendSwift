func distance(to destination: String) {
	print("1000 miles to \(destination).")
}

distance(to: "Wall Drug")

//: >Notice that you call the function as `distance(to:)` and not as `distance(destination:)`. By default, if you don't provide a label, (like if you created the function to say `func distance(destination: String)`) it would use the parameter name as both the label and internal parameter name. Customizing your labels allows you to make your code read more like English and therefore makes Swift a *self documenting* language, since it says exactly what it's doing.

//: ## Challenge
//: Create a function called `feed` that takes a single String parameter entitled `pet`. However, remove the label for `pet` outside the function. It should return nothing and print out "\(pet) was very hungry and is eating vigorously!" If you have some pets, test the function with each pet you have, otherwise make up some pet names that you wish you had. When calling your function, it should read like `feed("Sparkles")` and use no parameter label.
func feed(_ pet: String) {
    print("\(pet) was very hungry and is eating vigorously.")
}

feed("Autumn")
feed("Amara")
