//: >Similar to the previous challenge, sometimes, when functions are named with an action verb, it doesn't make sense to use a label and calling a function like this reads like English.

//: ## Challenge
//: Create a function called `add` that takes in two `Int` parameters named `operandOne` and `operandTwo` and add them together. This time, however, don't print the result, return it as an Int. When calling the function, it should look like `add(1, 3)` which would return `4`. You may uncomment the examples to test your answer.
func add(_ operandOne: Int, _ operandTwo: Int) -> Int {
    let sum = operandOne + operandTwo
        return sum
}


add(1, 1) // 2
add(4, 5) // 9
add(100, 1) // 101
add(40, 2) // 42
add(-5, 5) // 0
add(-5, -5) // -10
