//: ## Challenge
//: In the following code, `letter` has the potential to be any letter of the alphabet. Write some logic that prints out whether that the letter is a vowel (when it is), or a consonant (when it is).

let letter = "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".filter{ $0 != " " }.randomElement()!
switch letter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("'\(letter)' is a vowel.")
    default:
print("'\(letter)' is a consonant.")
}
